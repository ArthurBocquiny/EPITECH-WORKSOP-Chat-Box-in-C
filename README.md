# Chat-Box-in-C
Hello everyone here is a little worshop about network programming in C. You will realise a simple non-local chat box using select.

ðŸ’¡If you don't understand anything about select dont forget to ask one of the manager of the workshop


# Prerequisit
For the first step you will not write the client yet so to test your server you could use Telnet.

Here is the install :

Ubuntu :
```shell
sudo apt install telnetd -y
```
Fedora :
```shell
sudo dnf install dnf-plugins-core -y
sudo dnf install telnet telnet-server
```
# Step I : Server
Basically you have to make a server that can get multiple connections and if a message is sent by one the client, every client should get the message.
## I.a : Initialisation
Create a socket with IPv4 addressing and a TCP communication (man socket). 
Bind the socket to the following address : 
```c
struct sockaddr_in addr_server;
addr_server.sin_family = AF_INET;
addr_server.sin_port = htons(port);
addr_server.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr(ip_address);
```
Then, use the listen function (man listen) to marks the socket of the server referred to by "sockfd" as a passive socket taht can accept incoming connections.
## I.b : Accept a connection
Using the function accept (man accept) accept a new connection to your server. You can use Telnet to test if your server is accepting connections properly.
## I.c : Receive data from the client
You can now receive data from your client by using the socket given by the accept function and asking it to receive data from this file descriptor.
## I.d : Accept multiple connections
## I.e : Receive data from multiple clients
## I.f : Send some data to everybody

# Step II : Client
## II.a : Initialisation
## II.b : Connect to the server
## II.c : Get the client input without
## II.e : Send the input to the server
## II.f : Receive the data from the server

# Bonus
Be creative try to improve your chat box by adding usernames, login, error handling server-side.
