# [EPITECH-WORKSOP] Chat-Box-in-C
Hello everyone here is a little worshop about network programming in C.
You will realise a simple non-local chat box using select.
```
ðŸ’¡If you don't understand anything about select dont forget to ask one of the manager of the workshop
```
# Prerequisit
For the first step you will not write the client yet so to test your server you could use Telnet.
Here is the install :
Ubuntu :
```shell
sudo apt install telnetd -y
```
Fedora :
```shell
sudo dnf install dnf-plugins-core -y
sudo dnf install telnet telnet-server
```
# Step I : Server
Basically you have to make a server that can get multiple connections and if a message is sent by one the client, every client should get the message.
## I.a : Initialisation
## I.b : Accept a connection
## I.c : Accept multiple connections
## I.d
Your server must be initialised in a certain way.
# Step II : Client
## Step II.a : Initialisation
